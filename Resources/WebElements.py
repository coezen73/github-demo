# If we want to keep all these webElements in a single file,
# If we do not want to open and add or change or update all these files in other files like;
# HeaderPage, LandingPage, ProductDetailsPage.. etc., we can move these 'common locators' to an 'external python file',
#  and 'import' that file as a 'variable'

# Home Page Locators:

HomePageSearchTextBox = "xpath://*[@id='gh-ac']"
HomePageSearchButton = "xpath://*[@id='gh-btn']"
HomePageAdvancedSearchLink = "//*[@id='gh-as-a']"

# Landing Page Locators:

LandingPageXLocator = ""
LandingPageYLocator = ""
